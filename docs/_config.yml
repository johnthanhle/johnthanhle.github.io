  I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science and now I am a Software Engineer at [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/).
  During my studies, I interned at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) and a small YCombinator startup called [Stryve/Circle/Shopstack](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stryve-io), which has since rebranded as [Quill](https://www.quillsql.com/).
  My passion lies in full-stack and software development, as I find great fulfillment in creating applications that can make a positive impact on a wide range of people.
  In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton, cooking, playing Valorant, and reading.
